  <p>-Gary Lew</p>
  <p> I was born and raised in Germany and I joined the Army when I was 17. While in the military I served as a Rigger in a Special Forces unit. I developed and tested new types of equipment including bomb blankets and body armor. I also trained and operated
    extensivly in close quarters combat. While not working, training, or on deployment, I would spend my time instructing civilian, military, and law enforcement through a local academy. When I was 27 I got out of the military started a mixed martial
    arts and personal training company. A couple years ago I moved to Alexandria, Va and have been working on getting a degree in Biomedical Engineering. I am also curently studying Front-end web developement in my free time.</p>

  <h1> What do you want to do when you grow up?</h1>
  <p>I don’t have a dream job, I just want to be able to have the freedom to do pretty much whatever I want most of the time. I really enjoy traveling and moving around I really want to do something that I can take with me or that is worthwhile enough to
    keep up with once I finally decide to settle down. My goal is to put in enough work and find the right direction in order to make a worthwile living as a freelance web developer.</p>

  <h1> A little more about Jake </h1>
  <h2 style="color: #ffcc00;">What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>I enjoy studying new things, hiking, and anything outdoors</p>
  <h2 style="color: #ffcc00;">What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>I have been listening to a lot of instrumental music lately, no words just music, any genre. One of my favorites right now is this instrumental cover of a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qTZBwST7PI"> Ambition</a>.</p>
  <h2 style="color: #ffcc00;"> What is important to you?</h2>
  <p>Mindfulness is important to me. Being in control of myself and those things I am capable of being in control of. It is important to me to take time to think about the future and the past, not just of myself but of others. To understand the way things
    really are in order to come to a better understanding of what the word real means.
