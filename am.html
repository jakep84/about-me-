  <p> I was born and raised in Germany and I joined the Army when I was 17. While in the military I served as a Rigger in a Special Forces unit. I developed and tested new types of equipment including bomb blankets and body armor. I also trained and operated
    extensivly in close quarters combat. While not working, training, or on deployment, I would spend my time instructing civilian, military, and law enforcement through a local academy. When I was 27 I got out of the military started a mixed martial
    arts and personal training company. A couple years ago I moved to Alexandria, Va. I am currently teaching myself Front-end web developement. I really enjoy the constant small victory aspect and being able to train in the things that I need to know as the problem arises. It gives me a great feeling of acomplishment when I finish a product, or am able to fix that stubborn bug to make everything perfect. I also enjoy being able to learn new software and programs quickly and that there are a ton of them so I won't get bored any time soon. I love being able to constantly learn at an accelerated pace. I think my many years of training others has made me better able to begin to truly begin unlocking my own potential.</p>

  <h1> What do you want to do when you grow up?</h1>
  <p>I really enjoy coding and plan on always keeping it fresh, I really like that I can constantly push myself to be better and better at it. As far as developement goes I really want to work as a freelance developer. I wouldn't mind working for a larger company at first because I don't want to be good, I want to be great. I strive to do the best at anything I put my mind to and make solid plans to accomplish those goals. I also love that I can have a job anywhere I have a laptop and internet because I love to travel all over the world. I think that comes from my years in the military but I feel it is important to learn about other cultures and see what the world is really like for myself. I don't want to just read about things or see them on tv I want to live it. I really wouldn't mind being with a large company as long as I would be able to move around the company locations everyonce in a while. I am working hard on living in Copenhagen within the next couple years so that would be awesome and my be a big deciding factor if I would take the position. I also currently live in the Washignton, DC metro area so if it were located there that would be awesome. I probably wouldn't go for just any smaller businesses because I feel like I can better spend my time learning the newest ways and how things are done in that environment. I want to be the best so I need to learn from the best.</p>

  <p>I enjoy studying new things, hiking, and anything outdoors</p>
  <h2 class="questions">What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>I have been listening to a lot of instrumental music lately, no words just music, any genre. One of my favorites right now is this instrumental cover of a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qTZBwST7PI"> Ambition</a>.</p>
  <h2 class="questions"> What is important to you?</h2>
  <p>Mindfulness is important to me. Being in control of myself and those things I am capable of being in control of. It is important to me to take time to think about the future and the past, not just of myself but of others. To understand the way things
    really are in order to come to a better understanding of what the word real means.
